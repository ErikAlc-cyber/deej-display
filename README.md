# Introduction
This is a fork of the project [deej](https://github.com/omriharel/deej), I added SSD1306 display support.

## How to use
1. Open your Arduino IDE and go to Sketch > Include Library > Manage Libraries. The Library Manager should open.
2. Type “SSD1306” in the search box and install the SSD1306 library from Adafruit.
3. It will prompt a message to also install other libraries. Install those libraries.

## Caution
This is a "Dumb" implementation, keep in mind that is a work in progress, but feel free to suggest changes!!
